It’s not often that a man walks into a coffee shop expecting death to hand him his brew. 
Because as it goes, Monday morning is found beneath every Sunday night, and like every cycle, coffee starts as the catalyst.  This man, whom his friends call Ray, had no reason to expect anything other than the norm. Usually at most, the cashier misspells his name or the barista misreads it; nothing as peculiar as death would ever be hooded above him in this rainy city, let alone this Monday morning in his typical coffee shop. Ray was a regular man, drinking his regular vanilla latte. 
Death, who also prefers vanilla lattes, is a regular as well though much less so in this particular coffee shop. The small bells twinkled atop the opening door freeing the smell of fresh morning brew out into the cold and busy avenues. The clock read six-fifty. The day had just started and surely everyone was in the same “do nothing” state of mind. Yawns were cast into the air like last breaths, considering the one around at the moment. 
Hand in his back pocket, Ray considered if he should stick with his regular vanilla latte. The door behind him shut somewhat abruptly as he shifted his gaze to the menu above. Oceans of doubt suddenly flooded him; immediately he began to question why it was he chose the same thing every day, he was never original about his coffee, about his work, about anything, really. How come his life was so mundane, so full of the same joys and toils in every passing day? It was incredible to think that it had only hit him now, simply while standing in line for a coffee. Thought led to thought and soon could not be contained to a process within the back of his mind. Was he unknowingly confined within and chained to everyday routines such as ordering vanilla lattes? Even the act of standing in line seemed so mediocre in the moment that Ray wanted to run.
